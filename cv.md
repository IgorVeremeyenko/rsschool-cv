### About myself

I have no expirience in IT, but I would really like to plunge into it. After I worked as a software engineer for about 2 years, I wanted to develop further in this
profession. The constant desire to automate certain routine work at the computer gave me more and more reasons to take programming courses. But as I did not know in 
whitch direction to go, I began to study the basics of all the basics (each programming language a little bit). Thanks to this, I found myself in Front-End. And 
by the age of 35 I have a goal - to bacome a Middle Front-End Developer.

I still don’t know for sure if it’s mine or not. But how much time and effort I invest in training speaks for itself.

### Task:
>_To be a senior, a member must be at least 55 years old and have a handicap greater than 7. In this croquet club, handicaps range from -2 to +26; the better the player
>the lower the handicap._

**Example:**
>input =  [[18, 20], [45, 2], [61, 12], [37, 6], [21, 21], [78, 9]]
>
>output = ["Open", "Open", "Senior", "Open", "Open", "Senior"]

**Solution**
```
function openOrSenior(data){
  let resultStr = [];
  console.log('data ',data)
  for (let i = 0; i < data.length; i++){
    for(let k = 0; k < data[i].length; k++){
      if(data[i][k] >= 55 && data[i][k + 1] > 7){
        resultStr.push('Senior')
      }
      else resultStr.push('Open')
      break;
    }
  }
  console.log(resultStr)
  return resultStr;
}

I have a higher education, a specialist in Non-traditionally Energy Sourses(KNTU, Ukraine, Kherson). I took my first courses at the computer academy “STEP”.

It was very interesting and varied. I have had a lot of practice.

I speak English at a basic level. It’s very hard to learn it :)

But thanks to debugging the code, when you need to find a solution to a problem on an English-language forum, with the help of a googl translator, I can really even explain something now, understand when speaking. Now I live in Poland, here is English is much closer to me then Polish. And there are a lot of native speakers here, so I have no problem I’m exercising.
